## PyAsteroids

PyAsteroids is a classic asteroid-shooter game built in Python using the Pygame library. Players control a spaceship navigating an asteroid field, dodging and shooting asteroids while aiming for a high score. The game offers simple, arcade-style fun reminiscent of the original **Asteroids** game from the 80s.

### Features

- **Spaceship Movement**: Use "WASD" keys to maneuver and avoid asteroids.
- **Shooting**: Use "Space Bar" to fire bullets to destroy asteroids.
- **Asteroids**: Randomly generated from the edges of screen.
- **Classic Feel**: Retro visuals and mechanics for a nostalgic experience.
